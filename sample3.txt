Subject: Annual leave application

Dear Ganesh

I am writing this email with reference to my remaining annual leave quota. I am planning to go on a trip to Europe with my family. Thus, I would like to avail my remaining 25 days of annual leave from 13.01.2024 to 23.01.2024 

I have assigned my duties to Ragu for the current project we are working on. He/She has been working with me and understands the role effectively. Also, I am looking for all the essential inputs required for the project before I leave for the vacation.

I request you to consider my leave request. During my absence, I can be reached at my phone number - 98989 89898 and email id - krishna@abc.com. 

Yours sincerely

Krishna
